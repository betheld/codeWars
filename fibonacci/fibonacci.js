/* //PREP//
p: number, no funny business no 0
r: the nth element in the the sequence. 
e: fibonacci(4) //return 3
   fibonacci(6) //return 8
p: fibbonaci is just the addition of previous two nums in the sequence 
  -> first two nums are 1, so we can store that in an array 
  -> loop through the array adding each number to the previous and push to previous array
      -> because of our array storing 1,1 we can start adding from index 0
  -> return the last number in the array 
  -> NOTE: this solution would return one extra element in array, thus we use n-1 in loop
